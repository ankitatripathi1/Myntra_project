# Myntra Fashion Intelligence System - HackerRamp WeForShe 2025

## üéØ Theme & Problem Statement

### Themes Addressed
- **Primary**: Theme 2 - The GenZ Way of Shopping
- **Secondary**: Theme 1 - The Hyper-Personalization

### Problem Statement
Gen Z consumers face significant challenges in fashion discovery due to:
- Impersonal and generic recommendations that don't align with personal style
- Difficulty in finding products that match their specific "vibes"
- Limited ability to find items complementing their existing wardrobe
- Traditional search methods that rely only on basic keywords or single images
- Fragmented shopping experience leading to reduced engagement

### Core Problems Identified
1. **Limited Search Capabilities**
   - Separate image and text-based search without integration
   - Lack of combined multimodal search functionality

2. **Non-Personalized Video Feed**
   - Random content appearance in MyGlamCan
   - Missing relevance to user preferences

3. **Missing Intelligence Layer**
   - Lack of exclusion/pairing logic
   - Absent color combination intelligence
   - No wardrobe-aware recommendations

## üí° Our Solution
We've developed an advanced, personalized, vibe-based fashion discovery system that revolutionizes user engagement through context-aware personalization tailored for GenZ audiences. The system leverages AI-powered generative image understanding using BLIP(Salesfoce) and multi-modal search capabilities CLIP(GPT) to provide intelligent fashion recommendations.

### Key Solution Components
1. **Multimodal Fashion Intelligent Discovery Engine**
   - Combined text prompts, uploaded images, and wardrobe context in a single search
   - Natural language processing for price constraints ("under ‚Çπ1000")
   - GenZ slang and fashion terminology support ("aesthetic fits", "drip", "vibe")

2. **Wardrobe/Wishlist-Aware Fashion Intelligence**
   - Three-mode feed: Normal, Wardrobe-Similar(Haves), Wishlist-Similar(Have Nots)
   - Custom image upload capability for wishlist
   - Real-time relevance scoring system

3. **Advanced Fashion Intelligence**
   - Complementary Item Mapping for complete looks
   - AI-powered Color Coordination
   - Smart exclusion and pairing logic

## üé® Technical Architecture
1. **AI-Driven Style Understanding**
   - Utilizes CLIP model for advanced image-text matching
   - BLIP model for detailed fashion attribute extraction
   - Smart color coordination system

2. **Contextual Shopping Experience**
   - Wardrobe-aware recommendations
   - Style compatibility scoring
   - Occasion-based filtering

3. **Natural Language Processing**
   - Understanding of GenZ fashion terminology
   - Intelligent fashion intent recognition
   - Fuzzy matching for better search results

#### Embedding Search Space Flow
1. **Database (Videos)**
   - Stores product videos with metadata
   - Contains rich product information
   - Maintains hashtags and attributes

2. **Search Processing**
   - **Search Bar**: Handles both text and image inputs
   - **Prompt Processing**: Extracts fashion intent and constraints
   - **Image Processing**: Analyzes uploaded images for search

3. **AI Model Pipeline**
   - **Prompt Embedding**: Converts text to vector space using CLIP
   - **Image Caption Generation**: BLIP model for image understanding
   - **Product Description Embedding**: Generates product vectors
   - **Product Image Embedding**: Creates image feature vectors

4. **Context Integration**
   - **Wardrobe Context**: Personal closet analysis
   - **Wishlist Integration**: Desired items consideration
   - **Myntra Products**: Product catalog integration

5. **Intelligent Matching**
   - **Comparison Engine**: Cosine similarity computation
   - **Additional Images**: Supplementary visual context
   - **Relevance Scoring**: Multi-factor ranking system

   - Generates embeddings for text & images
   - Enables multi-modal search capabilities
   - Powers similarity matching

2. **BLIP Image Captioning**
   - Automated caption generation
   - Enhanced image understanding
   - Wardrobe/wishlist item analysis

### Data Processing Flow
1. **Input Processing**
   - Text prompt analysis
   - Image preprocessing
   - Wardrobe context integration

2. **Embedding Generation**
   - Product description embedding
   - Image feature embedding
